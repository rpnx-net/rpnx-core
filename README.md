# rpnx-core

A work in progress generic programming C++ library that provides cross platform C++ OS abstractions, data structures, and algorithms.

If you use this library, all symbols in the rpnx:: namespace and macros that begin with RPNX_ are reserved for use by the library.

Documentation will (eventually) be available here: https://rpnx-net.github.io/rpnx-core-docs-prebuilt/annotated.html

Documentation source (doxygen): https://github.com/rpnx-net/rpnx-core-docs
